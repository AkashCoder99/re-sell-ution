## Sprint 1 

GOAL : Build a working MVP locally with basic navigation, listings browse/details UI, and a backend listings API that the frontend can call.

### User Stories (Sprint 1)

US-01 Authentication
As a user, I want to register and login so I can create and manage listings.

US-02 Browse Listings
As a user, I want to browse listings so I can discover items available in my community.

US-03 Listing Details
As a user, I want to view a listing’s details so I can decide whether to contact the seller.

US-04 Create Listing
As a seller, I want to create a listing with item details and an image so I can sell an item.

US-05 Basic Project Setup
As a developer, I want a consistent frontend/backend setup and run instructions so all team members can run the project locally.

US-06 Validation and Errors
As a user, I want clear validation messages and error handling so the app doesn’t break on invalid input.
